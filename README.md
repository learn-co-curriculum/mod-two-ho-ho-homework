### Break Plans


* During break plan (Choose 1)
  * Curated solo project -> Deployed
  * 3 Blog Posts
  -- Topic Ideas
    * Testing with RSPEC
    * Performance with Rails  
    * Self Referential Associations
    * Uploading pictures with Carrierwave and S3
    * Rails Asset Pipeline - CSS & JS
    * Deploying with Heroku
    * PostgreSQL

### Solo Projects
* You should spend at least 4 days working on this project (at least 4 hours a day)
* If you would like to deploy your app on Heroku, use PostgresSQL in your project
** rails new myapp --database=postgresql

#### Requirements
* At least 4 models (1 has_many_through)
* Make at least two of your controllers full CRUD (Create Read Update Destroy)
* Some methods in your models. There should be at least 7 methods total across all of your models. These are to be used to better extract data from your tables (Ex. methods that execute ActiveRecord queries)
* Some CSS - custom or a framework (Example: Bootstrap)

#### Bonus
* Authorization is suggested** but optional
* Use an external API to seed your database

##### Timeline
* Come up with idea, model out domain
* Create and run your migrations, correctly establish relationships (NOTE* You can add more down the line but be sure to test your relationships before attempting to build out features)
* Establish which routes are needed for the appropriate controller
* Create your views
* Add model tests, start building out basic features
* Have some functionality built out by the end of day 2
* Iterate on the features that you built. Go from a 'skateboard' version to a scooter or a bicycle
* It doesnt' have to be perfect, but it should be working
* Start styling/ cleaning up issues.


### Bloggers

#### Requirements
* Blog posts must be code related including code snippets or examples of how you personally implemented what you learned
** REMEMBER* Always test your code before including it in your blog
* Each blog post should take you about 4 hours at least
* Research, research, research


We will be presenting blogs and projects come Tuesday morning when we get back!
